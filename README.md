# Object Drawing and Transformations in C
A written from scratch program that reads in a .obj file and draws it to screen

An OpenGL project that ustilizes basic OpenGL functions (specifically to create a rendering window) to read an .obj file through a file parser and draws the vertices, edges, and faces of the object. The program then gives the user control to play around with the object. Specifically, case 'v': To switch from prespective and 3D view, case 't': translate case 'e': scale object, case 'r': rotate object. Use w a s d to contol the object.
